# Unix for Beginners

The goal of this lesson is to learn 
* executing basic shell commands
* stitching individual commands into larger statements
* running bash scripts
* sneaking into text files with `grep`
* exploring file directories with `find`

We will use materials from the [Software Carpentry Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson.
